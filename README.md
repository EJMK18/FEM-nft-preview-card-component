## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Utilising the background properties such as background-position, background-size, and background-repeats were new. This allowed me to create size and position the background image for the overlay effect. Creating the overlay effect was interesting.

### Useful resources

- [Create a hover overlay effect](https://sirv.com/help/articles/hover-change-image/) - I used this format to create the hover overlay effect. Additionally, I made use of the developer tools to make a bit more sense of the HTML and CSS structures.
